# iDroid
iDroid is an operating system for phones that will be left open-sourced for people to edit at any time they'd like and even make their own OS out of it. I will be implementing Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri the user will also be able to change their homescreen and lockscreen to either an Android type design or even an iPhone type design for full customization!

## How to install
Sadly you cannot install as of now since we are still working on iDroidOS, we hope it will be released sometime this year.

## Early Development Pictures
Just wait for it...please...unless you want to see some ugly UI
